# Performance Optimization for Backend

## Profiling
- Profile code to find bottlenecks.

## Caching
- Use in-memory caches (Redis, Memcached) for frequently accessed data.

## Query Optimization
- Write efficient database queries and use pagination.

## Asynchronous Processing
- Offload heavy tasks to background jobs or queues.

## Resource Management
- Monitor and optimize CPU, memory, and I/O usage.

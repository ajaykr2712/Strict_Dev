# Security Best Practices

## Authentication and Authorization

### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- Something you know (password)
- Something you have (token, phone)
- Something you are (biometrics)
- Implementation with TOTP, SMS, or hardware tokens

### OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect
- Secure authorization framework
- Delegated access without sharing credentials
- Scopes for granular permissions
- JWT tokens for stateless authentication

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Users assigned to roles
- Roles have specific permissions
- Hierarchical role structures
- Principle of least privilege

### Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)
- Dynamic access decisions
- Based on user, resource, and environment attributes
- Fine-grained access control
- Policy-driven authorization

## Input Validation and Sanitization

### SQL Injection Prevention
- Use parameterized queries
- Input validation and sanitization
- Stored procedures with parameters
- ORM frameworks with built-in protection

### Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Prevention
- Output encoding/escaping
- Content Security Policy (CSP)
- Input validation
- Use secure frameworks

### Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Prevention
- Anti-CSRF tokens
- SameSite cookie attributes
- Double-submit cookies
- Referrer validation

## Data Protection

### Encryption at Rest
- Database encryption
- File system encryption
- Application-level encryption
- Key management and rotation

### Encryption in Transit
- TLS/SSL for all communications
- Certificate management
- Perfect Forward Secrecy
- Strong cipher suites

### Data Masking and Anonymization
- Mask sensitive data in non-production
- Anonymize data for analytics
- Pseudonymization techniques
- Data retention policies

## API Security

### Rate Limiting
- Prevent brute force attacks
- Protect against DDoS
- Different limits for different endpoints
- User-based and IP-based limiting

### API Keys and Tokens
- Secure API key generation
- Token expiration and rotation
- Scope-based access control
- Secure token storage

### Input Validation
- Schema validation
- Parameter validation
- Size limits
- Type checking

## Infrastructure Security

### Network Security
- Firewalls and security groups
- VPN for remote access
- Network segmentation
- Intrusion detection systems

### Container Security
- Secure base images
- Image vulnerability scanning
- Runtime security monitoring
- Secrets management

### Cloud Security
- Identity and Access Management (IAM)
- Service-specific security configurations
- Compliance frameworks
- Security monitoring and logging

## Monitoring and Incident Response

### Security Logging
- Authentication events
- Authorization failures
- Data access logs
- System configuration changes

### Threat Detection
- Anomaly detection
- Behavioral analysis
- Real-time monitoring
- Security information and event management (SIEM)

### Incident Response
- Incident response plan
- Communication procedures
- Forensic capabilities
- Recovery procedures

## AI and LLM Security Patterns

### AI Model Security
- Model validation and verification
- Adversarial attack protection
- Model poisoning prevention
- Secure model serving and versioning

### LLM-Specific Security
- Prompt injection prevention
- Output filtering and validation
- Context window management
- Conversation state security

### AI Data Privacy
- Differential privacy implementation
- Federated learning security
- Data anonymization for AI training
- PII detection and protection in AI outputs

- Bias monitoring and mitigation
- Performance anomaly detection
- Security event correlation with AI insights

### Chatbot and AI Assistant Security
- User authentication and authorization
- Session management for conversations
- Content moderation with AI
- Multi-modal input validation (text, image, audio)

### AI Infrastructure Security
- Secure model deployment pipelines
- Container security for AI workloads
- API security for AI services
- Secrets management for AI models

## Compliance and Privacy

### GDPR Compliance
- Data protection by design
- Right to be forgotten
- Data portability
- Consent management

### SOC 2 Compliance
- Security controls
- Availability measures
- Processing integrity
- Confidentiality protection

### HIPAA Compliance
- Protected health information (PHI)
- Access controls
- Audit logs
- Encryption requirements

## AI Integration Architecture Patterns

### 1. Multi-Provider Strategy Pattern

The Strategy pattern allows you to switch between different AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, local models) based on requirements:

**Benefits:**
- Provider diversity reduces vendor lock-in
- Cost optimization through provider selection
- Fallback mechanisms for high availability
- Different models for different use cases

**Implementation Considerations:**
```java
// Provider selection based on:
// - Cost per request
// - Response time requirements
// - Content sensitivity (local vs cloud)
// - Model capabilities (code, general chat, etc.)
```

### 2. Chain of Responsibility for Request Processing

Process AI requests through multiple validation and enhancement layers:

**Processing Chain:**
1. **Security Validation** - Authentication, authorization, rate limiting
2. **Content Moderation** - Input sanitization, harmful content detection
3. **Context Enhancement** - Conversation history, user preferences
4. **AI Processing** - Model selection and response generation
5. **Response Filtering** - Output validation, safety checks

### 3. Observer Pattern for AI Events

Monitor and react to AI system events in real-time:

**Event Types:**
- User interactions and conversation flows
- Security incidents and policy violations
- Performance metrics and model drift
- Cost tracking and budget alerts

## Security Patterns for AI Systems

### 1. Input Validation and Sanitization

**Prompt Injection Prevention:**
```java
// Validate and sanitize user inputs
// Check for system prompt manipulation attempts
// Implement content length limits
// Filter special characters and escape sequences
```

**Rate Limiting:**
- Per-user request limits
- Cost-based throttling
- Adaptive rate limiting based on usage patterns

### 2. Output Filtering and Validation

**Content Safety Checks:**
- Harmful content detection
- Personal information (PII) filtering
- Bias and fairness validation
- Factual accuracy verification

**Response Sanitization:**
- Remove sensitive information
- Apply content filtering rules
- Ensure compliance with regulations

### 3. Model Security

**Model Access Control:**
- Secure API key management
- Model versioning and rollback
- Access logging and audit trails
- Model performance monitoring

## LLM Provider Management

### 1. Provider Selection Criteria

- Regional availability
- SLA guarantees

**Capability Matching:**
- Model specialization (code, general, creative)
- Context window size
- Multi-modal support (text, image, audio)
- Language support

### 2. Fallback Strategies

**Hierarchical Fallback:**
1. Primary provider (best capability/cost ratio)
2. Secondary provider (backup)
3. Local model (for sensitive data)
4. Static responses (system failure)

**Intelligent Routing:**
- Health check monitoring
- Automatic failover
- Load balancing across providers
- Circuit breaker patterns

## Real-time Conversation Management

### 1. Conversation State Management

**State Pattern Implementation:**
- Initial state (greeting, onboarding)

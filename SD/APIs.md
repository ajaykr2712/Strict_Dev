# APIs

## Overview
An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software components to communicate. APIs are foundational to modern software, enabling integration, modularity, and scalability.

## Key Concepts
- **Endpoint:** A specific URL where an API can be accessed.
- **Request/Response:** Clients send requests (often HTTP), servers respond with data or status.
- **Serialization:** Data is often exchanged in formats like JSON or XML.
- **Versioning:** Managing changes to APIs without breaking clients.

## Advanced Topics
### 1. API Design Principles
- **RESTful Design:** Stateless, resource-oriented, uses standard HTTP methods.
- **GraphQL:** Flexible queries, single endpoint, client-driven data fetching.
- **gRPC:** High-performance, binary protocol, uses Protocol Buffers.
- **OpenAPI/Swagger:** Standardized documentation and contract generation.

### 2. Security
- **Authentication:** Verifying client identity (API keys, OAuth, JWT).
- **Authorization:** Controlling access to resources (scopes, roles).
- **Rate Limiting:** Preventing abuse by limiting request rates.
- **Input Validation:** Preventing injection and malformed data.

### 3. Performance
- **Caching:** Reduce load and latency (HTTP cache headers, CDN, reverse proxy).
- **Pagination:** Efficiently handle large datasets.
- **Batching:** Combine multiple requests into one.
- **Asynchronous APIs:** Webhooks, long polling, WebSockets.

### 4. Monitoring & Observability
- **Logging:** Track requests, errors, and usage.
- **Tracing:** Distributed tracing for microservices.
- **Metrics:** Latency, error rates, throughput.

### 5. Documentation & Developer Experience
- **Interactive Docs:** Swagger UI, Postman collections.
- **SDKs:** Client libraries for popular languages.
- **Error Handling:** Clear, consistent error messages and codes.

### 6. Real-World Example
- Twitter API: Enables third-party apps to post tweets, read timelines, etc.
- Stripe API: Powers payment processing for thousands of businesses.

### 7. Best Practices
- Use consistent naming conventions and HTTP status codes.
- Version your APIs and deprecate old versions gracefully.
- Provide clear, up-to-date documentation.
- Secure all endpoints and validate all inputs.

### 8. Interview Questions
- What are the differences between REST and GraphQL APIs?
- How would you secure a public API?
- How do you handle backward compatibility in API design?

# Blob Storage

## Overview
Blob storage (Binary Large Object storage) is a method for storing large amounts of unstructured data, such as images, videos, documents, and backups. It is a core component in cloud architectures and scalable systems, enabling efficient storage and retrieval of massive files.

## Key Concepts
- **Unstructured Data:** Stores data that doesnâ€™t fit neatly into tables (e.g., media files, logs).
- **Objects:** Each blob is stored as an object with metadata and a unique identifier.
- **Scalability:** Designed to handle petabytes of data and billions of objects.
- **Durability:** Uses replication and erasure coding to ensure data is not lost.

## Advanced Topics
### 1. Storage Tiers
- **Hot, Cool, and Archive:** Different tiers for frequently accessed, infrequently accessed, and long-term storage.
- **Lifecycle Management:** Automate moving blobs between tiers based on access patterns.

### 2. Access Patterns
- **Random Access:** Retrieve any object directly via its key.
- **Streaming:** Efficient for serving large files in chunks (e.g., video streaming).
- **Multipart Uploads:** Upload large files in parts for reliability and speed.

### 3. Security
- **Access Control:** Use tokens, signed URLs, or IAM policies to restrict access.
- **Encryption:** Data is encrypted at rest and in transit.

### 4. Real-World Example
- Cloud providers like AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, and Google Cloud Storage offer scalable blob storage.
- Media platforms store user uploads (photos, videos) as blobs for fast retrieval and sharing.

### 5. Best Practices
- Use appropriate storage tiers to optimize cost.
- Implement versioning and backups for critical data.
- Monitor usage and set up alerts for unusual access patterns.
- Use CDN integration for global, low-latency access.

### 6. Interview Questions
- What is blob storage and when would you use it?
- How do you secure access to blob storage?
- Explain the benefits of using lifecycle management in blob storage.

# Denormalization

## Overview
Denormalization is the process of deliberately introducing redundancy into a database by merging tables or duplicating data to optimize read performance. It is often used in large-scale systems where query speed is prioritized over strict normalization.

## Key Concepts
- **Redundancy:** Storing the same data in multiple places to reduce the need for complex joins.
- **Trade-offs:** Improved read performance at the cost of increased storage and potential data inconsistency.
- **Use Cases:** Analytics, reporting, and high-traffic applications where reads vastly outnumber writes.

## Advanced Topics
### 1. Denormalization Strategies
- **Precomputed Aggregates:** Store summary data (e.g., counts, sums) for fast retrieval.
- **Embedded Documents:** In NoSQL databases, nest related data within a single document.
- **Materialized Views:** Database objects that store the result of a query for quick access.

### 2. Challenges
- **Data Inconsistency:** Updates must be carefully managed to avoid stale or conflicting data.
- **Complex Writes:** More logic is required to keep redundant data in sync.
- **Storage Overhead:** Increased disk usage due to duplicated data.

### 3. Real-World Example
- E-commerce platforms denormalize product and order data to speed up catalog browsing and order history queries.
- Social networks denormalize user feeds for fast timeline rendering.

### 4. Best Practices
- Denormalize only when necessary and after profiling performance bottlenecks.
- Automate data synchronization with triggers, application logic, or ETL jobs.
- Monitor for data anomalies and implement reconciliation processes.

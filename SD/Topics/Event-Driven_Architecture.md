# Event-Driven Architecture

## Overview
Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) is a software architecture pattern where the flow of the program is determined by events such as user actions, sensor outputs, or messages from other programs. It promotes loose coupling between services and enables real-time processing of events as they occur.

## Key Concepts
- **Events**: Immutable records of something that happened in the system
- **Event Producers**: Components that generate and publish events
- **Event Consumers**: Components that subscribe to and process events
- **Event Store**: Persistent storage for events
- **Event Bus/Broker**: Infrastructure that facilitates event communication

## Advanced Topics

### 1. Event Types
- **Domain Events**: Business-relevant events (OrderPlaced, PaymentProcessed)
- **System Events**: Technical events (UserLoggedIn, SystemStarted)
- **Integration Events**: Cross-bounded context events for microservices

### 2. Event Ordering and Consistency
- **Event Ordering**: Ensuring events are processed in the correct sequence
- **Eventual Consistency**: System becomes consistent over time
- **Event Sourcing**: Storing events as the primary source of truth
- **CQRS Integration**: Separating command and query models

### 3. Event Processing Patterns
- **Simple Event Processing**: One-to-one event handling
- **Stream Processing**: Processing continuous streams of events
- **Complex Event Processing (CEP)**: Pattern detection across multiple events
- **Event Correlation**: Linking related events together

### 4. Implementation Strategies
```
Event Producer → Event Bus → Event Consumer
     ↓             ↓             ↓
[OrderService] → [Apache Kafka] → [InventoryService]
               ↘                ↗ [EmailService]
                 [Event Store]   [PaymentService]
```

### 5. Benefits
- **Loose Coupling**: Services don't need direct knowledge of each other
- **Scalability**: Easy to add new event consumers
- **Fault Tolerance**: Failed consumers don't affect producers
- **Real-time Processing**: Events can be processed as they occur
- **Auditability**: Complete history of system changes

### 6. Challenges
- **Event Schema Evolution**: Managing changes to event structure
- **Event Ordering**: Ensuring correct sequence in distributed systems
- **Duplicate Events**: Handling idempotency and exactly-once processing
- **Error Handling**: Managing failed event processing
- **Debugging**: Tracing event flows across multiple services

### 7. Event Broker Technologies
- **Apache Kafka**: High-throughput, distributed streaming platform
- **Amazon EventBridge**: Serverless event bus service
- **RabbitMQ**: Message broker with event routing capabilities
- **Apache Pulsar**: Multi-tenant, multi-cluster messaging system
- **Redis Streams**: Stream data structure for event processing

### 8. Best Practices
- Design events to be immutable and self-contained
- Use versioning for event schema evolution
- Implement idempotent event handlers
- Monitor event processing latency and throughput
- Use dead letter queues for failed events
- Implement proper error handling and retry mechanisms

### 9. Real-world Examples
- **E-commerce**: Order processing, inventory updates, notifications
- **Financial Systems**: Transaction processing, fraud detection
- **IoT Platforms**: Sensor data processing, device management
- **Social Media**: Activity feeds, notifications, content moderation

### 11. Event Flow Diagram
```
[User Action] → [Order Service] → [Event: OrderPlaced]
                                         ↓
                  [Event Bus (Kafka/RabbitMQ)]
                         ↓        ↓         ↓
            [Inventory Service] [Email Service] [Payment Service]
                    ↓               ↓              ↓
           [Event: StockUpdated] [Event: EmailSent] [Event: PaymentProcessed]
```

### 12. Implementation Example (Pseudocode)
```python
# Event Producer
class OrderService:
    def place_order(self, order_data):
        order = Order.create(order_data)
        event = OrderPlacedEvent(order.id, order.customer_id, order.items)
        event_bus.publish('order.placed', event)
        return order

# Event Consumer
class InventoryService:
    @event_handler('order.placed')
    def handle_order_placed(self, event):
        for item in event.items:
            self.update_stock(item.product_id, -item.quantity)
        inventory_event = StockUpdatedEvent(event.order_id, event.items)
        event_bus.publish('inventory.updated', inventory_event)
```

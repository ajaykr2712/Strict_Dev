# 🧪 API Testing: Types, Explanations & Code Examples

API testing is a critical part of the software development lifecycle. It ensures APIs are reliable, secure, performant, and behave as expected. Here's a breakdown of all major types of API testing, explained clearly, with examples and code snippets.

---

## 🚀 Advanced API Testing Insights

> **Motivational Note:** "Great APIs are built, not born. Every test you write is a step toward bulletproof software!"

- **Automation Frameworks:** Explore tools like Postman, RestAssured, SuperTest, and Karate for robust automation.
- **CI/CD Integration:** Integrate API tests into pipelines using Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or GitLab CI for continuous quality.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Beware of hardcoded data, missing negative tests, and ignoring edge cases.
- **Fun Fact:** Netflix runs thousands of API tests per minute to ensure global reliability.
- **Visual Tip:** Use sequence diagrams to map API call flows and dependencies.

---

## 1. ✅ **Functional Testing**
### **Goal:** Ensure the API behaves according to the functional requirements.

### **Example Scenario:** Validate a POST `/login` API returns a 200 status and a token.

```python
import requests

response = requests.post("http://api.example.com/login", json={"username": "admin", "password": "admin123"})
assert response.status_code == 200
assert "token" in response.json()
```

**Advanced Tip:** Use parameterized tests to cover multiple input combinations efficiently.

**Real-World Scenario:** Test both valid and invalid credentials, and ensure error messages are clear and actionable.

---

## 2. 🔒 **Security Testing**
### **Goal:** Verify that the API is secure from external threats like SQL injection, XSS, etc.

### **Example Scenario:** Check for SQL injection vulnerability.

```python
malicious_input = "admin' OR '1'='1"
response = requests.post("http://api.example.com/login", json={"username": malicious_input, "password": "pass"})
assert response.status_code == 401  # Should not allow login
```

**Advanced Tip:** Automate security scans using tools like OWASP ZAP or Burp Suite.

**Common Pitfall:** Failing to sanitize user inputs can expose critical vulnerabilities.

**Motivational Note:** "Every security test you automate is a wall against attackers."

---

## 3. ⚡ **Performance Testing**
### **Goal:** Measure the speed, scalability, and responsiveness of the API.

### **Example Tool:** `locust`, `k6`, `Apache JMeter`

```python
# Example: k6 script
import http from 'k6/http';
import { sleep } from 'k6';

export default function () {
  http.get('http://api.example.com/users');
  sleep(1);
}
```

**Advanced Tip:** Monitor response times under varying loads and set performance budgets.

**Real-World Scenario:** Simulate peak traffic (e.g., Black Friday sales) to ensure stability.

---

## 4. 🔄 **Load Testing**
### **Goal:** Determine how the API handles heavy traffic.

### **Tool:** Postman, Apache JMeter, k6

```javascript
// Example: Simulate 100 virtual users in k6
export let options = {
  vus: 100,
  duration: '30s',
};
```

**Advanced Tip:** Use distributed load generators for large-scale simulations.

**Common Pitfall:** Not monitoring backend resources (CPU, DB connections) during load tests.

---

## 5. 📦 **Validation Testing**
### **Goal:** Ensure the API returns correct status codes, headers, and payload formats.

```python
response = requests.get("http://api.example.com/user/123")
assert response.status_code == 200
assert response.headers['Content-Type'] == 'application/json'
assert "id" in response.json()
```

**Advanced Tip:** Use JSON Schema validation to enforce payload structure.

**Motivational Note:** "Validation tests are your contract with the frontend and third-party integrators."

---

## 6. 🧪 **Unit Testing (API Layer)**
### **Goal:** Test individual functions or services independently.

```python
# test_utils.py
from utils import get_user_name

def test_get_user_name():
    assert get_user_name(5) == "John Doe"
```

**Advanced Tip:** Mock external dependencies to isolate logic.

**Common Pitfall:** Over-mocking can hide integration issues.

---

## 7. 🧭 **UI Integration Testing**
### **Goal:** Test API response behavior via UI

```javascript
// Cypress example
cy.request("GET", "/api/products").then((response) => {
  expect(response.status).to.eq(200);
});
```

**Advanced Tip:** Automate end-to-end flows with tools like Cypress or Playwright.

**Fun Fact:** UI integration tests often catch issues missed by API-only tests.

---

## 8. 🔁 **End-to-End Testing (E2E)**
### **Goal:** Test a complete flow involving multiple APIs

```python
# Create user → Login → Fetch profile

response = requests.post("/create_user", json={"name": "Ajay", "email": "ajay@example.com"})
user_id = response.json()['id']

login = requests.post("/login", json={"email": "ajay@example.com", "password": "12345"})
token = login.json()['token']

profile = requests.get(f"/profile/{user_id}", headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {token}"})
assert profile.status_code == 200
```

**Advanced Tip:** Chain API calls and validate data consistency across services.

**Real-World Scenario:** Simulate user journeys from signup to checkout.

---

## 9. 🔄 **Regression Testing**
### **Goal:** Ensure existing functionalities aren’t broken by new code.

Often automated through CI pipelines:

```yaml
# GitHub Action Example
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Run Tests
        run: pytest
```

**Advanced Tip:** Use test tagging to run only impacted tests for faster feedback.

**Motivational Note:** "Regression tests are your safety net—never deploy without them!"

---

## 10. 🧰 **Mock Testing**
### **Goal:** Simulate the API when the actual service is down or incomplete.

### **Tools:** Postman Mock Server, WireMock, MSW

```json
// Postman mock response
{
  "id": "123",
  "name": "Mock User"
}
```

**Advanced Tip:** Use contract testing (e.g., Pact) to ensure mocks match real API behavior.

**Common Pitfall:** Outdated mocks can lead to false positives.

---

## 🛠️ Automation Frameworks & CI/CD Integration

- **Popular Frameworks:** Postman, RestAssured, Karate, SuperTest, PyTest, Mocha, Cypress, Playwright
- **CI/CD Integration:** Use plugins or scripts to trigger API tests on every commit or pull request.
- **Visualization:** Integrate dashboards (e.g., Allure, ReportPortal) for real-time test reporting.

---

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls in API Testing

- Ignoring negative and edge cases
- Not cleaning up test data
- Overlooking rate limits and throttling
- Failing to test under real-world network conditions

## 🎨 Visual Elements & Infographics

> **Suggestion:** Add sequence diagrams for API workflows, flowcharts for test strategies, and infographics for test coverage metrics.

# Error Handling & Resilience

## Graceful Degradation
- Ensure the system continues to function at a reduced level during failures.

## Circuit Breaker Pattern
- Prevent cascading failures by stopping calls to failing services.

## Retries & Timeouts
- Retry failed operations with exponential backoff and set timeouts.

## Centralized Error Logging
- Aggregate and monitor errors for faster resolution.

## User-Friendly Error Messages
- Provide clear, actionable error messages to clients.

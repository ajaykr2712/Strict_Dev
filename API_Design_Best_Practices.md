# API Design Best Practices

## RESTful & gRPC APIs
- Use resource-based URLs and standard HTTP methods.
- Consider gRPC for high-performance needs.

## Versioning
- Version your APIs (e.g., /v1/resource).

## Consistent Error Handling
- Use standard error codes and messages.

## Documentation
- Provide OpenAPI/Swagger docs or similar.

## Security
- Use authentication and authorization for all endpoints.

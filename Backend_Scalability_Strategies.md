# Backend Scalability Strategies

## Stateless Services
- Design services to be stateless for easy horizontal scaling.

## Load Balancing
- Use load balancers to distribute traffic evenly.

## Database Scaling
- Use replication, sharding, and partitioning.
- Employ caching layers (Redis, Memcached).

## Asynchronous Processing
- Use message queues and background jobs for heavy tasks.

## Auto-Scaling
- Configure auto-scaling for cloud resources.

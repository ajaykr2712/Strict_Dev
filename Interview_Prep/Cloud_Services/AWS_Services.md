## Cloud Computing Fundamentals

### Q1: What is Cloud Computing and explain its service models?

**Answer:**

Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet ("the cloud") to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale.

#### Service Models:

**1. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**
- **Definition**: Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet
- **Components**: Virtual machines, storage, networks, operating systems
- **Examples**: AWS EC2, Azure Virtual Machines, Google Compute Engine
- **Use Cases**: 
  - Web hosting and application development
  - High-performance computing
  - Storage and backup solutions
  - Development and testing environments

**Scenario Example:**
```
Company X needs to host a new web application:
- Instead of buying physical servers ($50,000+ upfront)
- Use AWS EC2 instances ($100-500/month based on usage)
- Scale up during peak traffic, scale down during low usage
- Pay only for what you use
```

**2. Platform as a Service (PaaS)**
- **Definition**: Provides a platform for developing, running, and managing applications
- **Components**: Development tools, database management, business analytics
- **Examples**: AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Google App Engine, Heroku
- **Use Cases**:
  - Rapid application development
  - API development and management
  - Business analytics and intelligence

**Scenario Example:**
```
Startup needs to deploy a Java Spring Boot application:
- Without PaaS: Setup servers, configure OS, install Java, setup load balancers
- With AWS Elastic Beanstalk: Just upload JAR file, automatic deployment
- Platform handles: Load balancing, auto-scaling, health monitoring
```

**3. Software as a Service (SaaS)**
- **Definition**: Software applications delivered over the internet
- **Examples**: Gmail, Salesforce, Microsoft Office 365, Slack
- **Use Cases**: Email, CRM, productivity software, collaboration tools

#### Deployment Models:

**Public Cloud**
- Shared infrastructure, cost-effective, high scalability
- Examples: AWS, Azure, Google Cloud

**Private Cloud**

|--------|------|-------|--------|----------|---------|
| **General Purpose** | t3.micro | 2 | 1 GB | Web servers, small databases | t3.micro, m5.large |
| **Compute Optimized** | c5.large | 2 | 4 GB | CPU-intensive applications | c5.xlarge, c6i.large |
| **Memory Optimized** | r5.large | 2 | 16 GB | In-memory databases | r5.xlarge, x1e.xlarge |
| **Storage Optimized** | i3.large | 2 | 15.25 GB | NoSQL databases, data warehousing | i3.large, d2.xlarge |
| **Accelerated Computing** | p3.2xlarge | 8 | 61 GB | Machine learning, HPC | p3.2xlarge, g4dn.xlarge |

#### Pricing Models:

**1. On-Demand Instances**
```
- Pay per hour/second with no long-term commitments
- No upfront costs or minimum fees
- Increase/decrease compute capacity based on demand
- Use case: Short-term, irregular workloads that cannot be interrupted

Example: 
t3.micro: $0.0104 per hour
m5.large: $0.096 per hour
```

**2. Reserved Instances (RI)**
```
- 1 or 3-year commitment with significant discount (up to 75%)
- Types: Standard RI, Convertible RI, Scheduled RI
- Payment options: All upfront, partial upfront, no upfront

Example:
On-demand m5.large: $0.096/hour = $840/year
1-year Standard RI: ~$0.058/hour = $508/year (40% savings)
```

**3. Spot Instances**
```
- Bid for unused EC2 capacity (up to 90% discount)
- Can be terminated with 2-minute notice when AWS needs capacity
- Use case: Fault-tolerant, flexible workloads

Example:
On-demand m5.large: $0.096/hour
Spot m5.large: ~$0.029/hour (70% savings)
```

**4. Dedicated Hosts**

│  └─────────────────┘   │        │  └─────────────────┘   │
└─────────────────────────┘        └─────────────────────────┘
```

#### Implementation Strategy:

**1. Database Replication:**
```
Primary Database (us-east-1):
- RDS MySQL with Multi-AZ
- Automated backups every hour
- Cross-region read replica in us-west-2

Secondary Database (us-west-2):
- Read replica with automatic backups
- Can be promoted to standalone DB in <15 minutes
- Database migration service for continuous replication
```

**2. Application Deployment:**
```
Primary Region:
- Auto Scaling Group: 3-10 instances
- Application Load Balancer
- Full production environment

Secondary Region:
- Pilot Light approach:
  - Minimal infrastructure (1-2 instances)
  - AMIs and Launch Templates ready
  - Auto Scaling Groups configured but scaled to 0
  - Can scale up to full capacity in 30 minutes
```

**3. Data Replication:**
```
S3 Cross-Region Replication:
- Real-time replication of critical data
- Versioning enabled for point-in-time recovery
- Lifecycle policies for cost optimization

EBS Snapshots:
- Automated daily snapshots
- Cross-region copy for disaster recovery
- Encrypted snapshots for security compliance
```

**4. DNS and Traffic Management:**
```
Route 53 Health Checks:
- Primary endpoint health monitoring
- Automatic failover to secondary region
- TTL set to 60 seconds for quick failover

Failover Configuration:
- Primary: us-east-1 (priority 100)
- Secondary: us-west-2 (priority 200)
- Health check interval: 30 seconds
```

#### Recovery Procedures:

**Automated Failover (RTO: 10-15 minutes):**
```
1. Route 53 detects primary region failure
2. DNS automatically points to secondary region
3. Application instances auto-scale up
4. Read replica promoted to primary database
5. Application connects to new primary DB
```

**Manual Failover (RTO: 2-4 hours):**
```
1. Operations team validates the disaster
2. Execute disaster recovery runbook
3. Scale up secondary region infrastructure
4. Promote read replica to primary
5. Update application configuration
6. Redirect traffic via Route 53
7. Validate all systems functional
```

**Recovery Testing:**
```
Quarterly DR Tests:
- Scheduled failover to secondary region
- Validate RTO/RPO objectives
- Test all recovery procedures
- Document lessons learned
- Update runbooks as needed
```

#### Compliance Considerations:

**Financial Regulations:**
```
1. Data Encryption:
   - Encryption at rest (S3, RDS, EBS)
   - Encryption in transit (TLS/SSL)
   - KMS key management

2. Audit Trail:
   - CloudTrail for API logging
   - VPC Flow Logs for network monitoring
   - Database audit logs

3. Access Control:
   - IAM roles with least privilege

> **"Excellence in system design comes from deliberate practice and continuous learning"**

Welcome to **Strict Dev** - your comprehensive resource for mastering system design concepts, patterns, and implementation strategies. This repository is designed for software engineers, architects, and students who want to build robust, scalable, and maintainable systems with **advanced AI and LLM integration capabilities**.

## 🎯 Mission

To create a structured learning path for system design mastery through:
- **Daily topic exploration** with real-world examples (Netflix, Uber, WhatsApp)
- **Practical implementation patterns** with working Java code
- **AI/LLM integration patterns** for modern chatbots and assistants
- **Security-first approach** with comprehensive security patterns
- **Interview preparation** resources and hands-on challenges
- **Complete framework mapping** showing file interconnections

## 🗺️ **Framework Overview**

📋 **[COMPREHENSIVE_FRAMEWORK_MAPPING.md](COMPREHENSIVE_FRAMEWORK_MAPPING.md)** - Complete guide to how all files interconnect to form a unified learning framework

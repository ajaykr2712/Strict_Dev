> **"Excellence in system design comes from deliberate practice and continuous learning"**

Welcome to **Strict Dev** - your comprehensive resource for mastering system design concepts, patterns, and implementation strategies. This repository is designed for software engineers, architects, and students who want to build robust, scalable, and maintainable systems.

## 🎯 Mission

To create a structured learning path for system design mastery through:
- **Daily topic exploration** with real-world examples
- **Practical implementation patterns** and code samples
- **Interview preparation** resources
- **Hands-on scripts** for testing concepts

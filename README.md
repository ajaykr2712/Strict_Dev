## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### 1. **Foundation Level** (Low-Level Design)
Start with design patterns and object-oriented principles:
```bash
# Begin with core design patterns
cd 01_LOW_LEVEL_DESIGN/Design_Patterns/Creational
# Study Singleton, Factory, Builder patterns

# Learn SOLID principles
cd ../../../Object_Oriented_Design/SOLID_Principles
# Understand Single Responsibility, Open/Closed principles
```

### 2. **Intermediate Level** (System Architecture)
Move to system-level thinking:
```bash
# Explore architectural patterns
cd 02_HIGH_LEVEL_DESIGN/System_Architecture/Microservices
# Learn service decomposition, API design

# Study distributed systems
cd ../Distributed_Systems/Consistency
# Understand CAP theorem, ACID properties
```

### 3. **Advanced Level** (Real-World Systems)
Apply knowledge to real scenarios:
```bash
# Analyze case studies
cd 02_HIGH_LEVEL_DESIGN/Real_World_Case_Studies/Netflix
# Learn how Netflix handles millions of concurrent streams

# Practice system design problems
cd ../../../01_LOW_LEVEL_DESIGN/System_Design_Problems/Chat_System
# Design WhatsApp-like messaging system
```

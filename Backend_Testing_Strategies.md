# Backend Testing Strategies

## Unit Testing
- Test individual functions and methods in isolation.
- Use frameworks like JUnit, pytest, or Mocha.

## Integration Testing
- Test interactions between components (e.g., database, APIs).

## End-to-End Testing
- Simulate real user scenarios across the system.

## Test Automation
- Integrate tests into CI/CD pipelines for fast feedback.

## Mocking & Stubbing
- Use mocks and stubs to isolate dependencies during tests.

# Database Design Principles

## Normalization & Denormalization
- Normalize to reduce redundancy; denormalize for performance when needed.

## Indexing
- Use indexes to speed up queries, but avoid over-indexing.

## Transactions
- Use transactions for atomicity and consistency.

## Data Modeling
- Choose relational, NoSQL, or NewSQL based on use case.

## Backup & Recovery
- Implement regular backups and test recovery procedures.

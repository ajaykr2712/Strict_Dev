## 💡 Key Learnings

### From Meta (GraphQL)
1. **Schema-First Design**: Well-designed schemas prevent breaking changes
2. **Batching is Essential**: DataLoader pattern eliminates N+1 queries
3. **Complexity Limits**: Must protect against expensive queries
4. **Caching Layers**: Multi-tier caching provides best performance

### From Amazon (Caching)
1. **Consistent Hashing**: Essential for distributed systems
2. **Cache Invalidation**: Hardest problem in computer science
3. **Replication vs Consistency**: Choose based on use case
4. **Always Have Fallback**: Database backup when cache fails

### From Google (Rate Limiting)
1. **Token Bucket**: Best algorithm for most scenarios
2. **Multi-Dimensional**: Limit by user, IP, endpoint, and globally
3. **Clear Communication**: Headers help users understand limits
4. **Burst Capacity**: Allow temporary spikes within reason

## 🎓 When to Use Each Pattern

### Use GraphQL Gateway When:
- Building mobile applications with bandwidth constraints
- Need to aggregate data from multiple microservices
- Want to reduce number of API calls
- Frontend and backend teams work independently
- Data requirements vary by client (web, mobile, IoT)

### Use Distributed Caching When:
- Database becomes bottleneck (high read load)
- Need sub-millisecond response times
- Data is read much more than written
- Have global user base requiring low latency
- Want to reduce database costs

### Use Rate Limiting When:
- Offering tiered API subscriptions
- Need to protect against DDoS attacks
- Want fair resource allocation
- Monetizing APIs
- Preventing cost overruns from runaway services

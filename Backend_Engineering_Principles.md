# Backend Engineering Principles

A guide to the most important principles for building robust, scalable, and maintainable backend systems.

## 1. Separation of Concerns
- Organize code into layers (controllers, services, repositories).
- Each module should have a single responsibility.

## 2. Scalability
- Design for horizontal scaling (stateless services, distributed databases).
- Use load balancers and partition data when needed.

## 3. Security
- Validate and sanitize all inputs.
- Use authentication and authorization.
- Encrypt sensitive data.
- Apply the principle of least privilege.

## 4. Reliability & Fault Tolerance
- Implement retries, circuit breakers, and graceful degradation.
- Use proper error handling and monitoring.

## 5. Performance Optimization
- Use caching, database indexing, and asynchronous processing.
- Profile and optimize critical code paths.

## 6. Observability
- Add logging, metrics, and distributed tracing (e.g., OpenTelemetry).
- Monitor system health and set up alerts.

## 7. API Design
- Use RESTful or gRPC APIs with clear versioning.
- Provide thorough documentation and consistent error handling.

## 8. Testing
- Write unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.
- Automate testing in CI/CD pipelines.

## 9. Documentation
- Keep API, architecture, and deployment docs up to date.

## 10. Maintainability
- Write clean, modular, and well-documented code.
- Use code reviews and adhere to coding standards.

# Observability and Monitoring

## Logging
- Log important events, errors, and business metrics.
- Use structured logging for better analysis.

## Metrics
- Collect metrics on latency, throughput, error rates, etc.
- Use tools like Prometheus, Grafana.

## Distributed Tracing
- Implement tracing (e.g., OpenTelemetry) to follow requests across services.

## Alerting
- Set up alerts for critical failures and performance issues.

## Health Checks
- Implement readiness and liveness probes.

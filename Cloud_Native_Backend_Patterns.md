# Cloud-Native Backend Patterns

## Microservices
- Decompose applications into independently deployable services.

## Service Discovery
- Use service registries for dynamic endpoint resolution.

## Configuration Management
- Store configuration outside the codebase (e.g., environment variables).

## Resilience Patterns
- Implement retries, circuit breakers, and bulkheads.

## Containerization
- Use Docker and orchestration tools (Kubernetes) for deployment.

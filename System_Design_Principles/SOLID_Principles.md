# System Design Principles

## SOLID Principles in System Design

### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- Each component should have only one reason to change
- Microservices should handle single business capabilities
- Classes should have one job

### Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
- Software entities should be open for extension, closed for modification
- Use interfaces and abstract classes for extensibility
- Plugin architecture example

### Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
- Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of subclasses
- Contract compliance in inheritance hierarchies
- Interface implementations must honor contracts

### Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they don't use
- Create focused, specific interfaces
- Avoid fat interfaces

### Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
- High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules
- Both should depend on abstractions
- Dependency injection implementation

## Additional Design Principles

### DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- Every piece of knowledge must have a single representation
- Code reusability and maintainability
- Configuration management

### KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)
- Simplicity should be a key goal
- Avoid unnecessary complexity
- Clear and readable code

### YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)
- Don't add functionality until deemed necessary
- Avoid over-engineering
- Focus on current requirements

## Distributed Systems Principles

### CAP Theorem
- Consistency, Availability, Partition tolerance
- Choose two out of three
- Trade-offs in distributed systems

### BASE Properties
- Basically Available, Soft state, Eventual consistency
- Alternative to ACID in distributed systems
- NoSQL database characteristics

### Twelve-Factor App Methodology
1. Codebase - One codebase tracked in revision control
2. Dependencies - Explicitly declare and isolate dependencies
3. Config - Store config in the environment
4. Backing services - Treat backing services as attached resources
5. Build, release, run - Strictly separate build and run stages
6. Processes - Execute the app as one or more stateless processes
7. Port binding - Export services via port binding
8. Concurrency - Scale out via the process model
9. Disposability - Maximize robustness with fast startup and graceful shutdown
10. Dev/prod parity - Keep development, staging, and production as similar as possible
11. Logs - Treat logs as event streams
12. Admin processes - Run admin/management tasks as one-off processes
